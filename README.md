# HK_MEMORY_GAME
This is a match game made using python's gaming module pygame. The program runs a memory game that allows you to turn over cards by clicking the mouse. Each grey box represents the image of an animal hidden by default. If there is a match, the two cards will disappear, leaving a blank white space and giving a message "MATCHED". If not, they will flip back over.
